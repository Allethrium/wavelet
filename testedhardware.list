Tested Hardware:

PC's:

	12th Gen Intel Core-I5 or better CPU
	Required for VA-API / QuickSync video core

	For low-power, good results on Alder-Lake based SBC boards such as upcoming ZimaBlade, ZX05 etc.
	HW acceleration necesary due to tight CPU constraints.  Probably make stellar low-cost decoders!

	WiFi 6 networking via PCIe is highly recommended, 5ghz wifi capability is effectively a requirement. USB works, however does introduce some overhead.
	B/G Band WiFi works, but very poorly.

	Older CPU's will work, but may struggle particularly with more advanced HEVC/VP9/AV1 codecs

	Not tested-
		NVIDIA HW Acceleration (no available hw platform)
		AMD HW Acceleration (no available hw platform)

	No issues with AMD CPU's for software-based decoding, but has only been briefly tested in home lab.

tested SBC's: 
+	manufacturer images
+	armbian
+	fedora ARM

	Khadas:
		VIM1			-	Too Slow, HDMI output issues.
		VIM3S			-	Functional, but blacks are crushed on video output.  HW Video acceleration and therefore custom kernel is a requirement.
		Edge2			-	WiFi 5ghz is broken, requires proprietary kernel for proper video acceleration, non-starter until these issues are fixed.
	
	Orange Pi:
		OrangePi 4LTS	-	Software acceleration only, struggles on nearly every codec

	Odroid:
		Odroid M1		-	Manufacturer is missing wifi kernel modules, struggles on most codecs due to older design

	Raspberry Pi:
		?

	Here, I think we are waiting for that one SBC unicorn with proper mainline kernel support.  Suggestions are more than welcome.



Networking Equipment:

Wired:
	Extreme Networks switch (8port)
	TP-Link unmanaged switch


Wireless:
	Ruckus R350 Access Point 	-	Currently the recommended standard
	Ubiquiti AC-Pro				-	Functional but lacking WiFi6 support
	Ubiquiti UAP				-	B/G band WiFi too slow, worked on one or two decoders but performance was spotty
	Extreme Networks			-	AP needs a standalone mode, many enterprise AP's are not suitable for this reason

Network Cards:
	Hawking WiFi 6 USB 			-	Functional but USB adds unacceptable overhead
	Intel Built-In ??			-	No issues
	Mellanox CX2				-	To be tested (RoCE/RDMA support to further lower latency?)

HDMI Capture Devices:
	MageWell HDMI Capture Pro 	-	Fully supported.  Can be spotty on HDMI input due to HDCP issues
	LG USB Capture Cards		-	Fully supported.  Large delay when spinning up V4L2 capture, however.  Less fussy about inputs than the Magewell
	Decklink					-	On shopping list, would also like to add SDI support

USB Input Devices:
	IPEVO Ziggy Document Camera - 	Fully supported @ 1080/30fps.   On some machines refuses to capture at above 15fps, however.
	ELMO document camera		-	not yet tested
	TESIRA ex-UBT				-	not yet tested (linux support on website isn't alluded to)
	?							- 	This is likely where we'll see the most devices eventually.
