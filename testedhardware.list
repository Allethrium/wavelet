Tested Hardware:

PC's:

	-	12th Gen Intel Core-I5 or better CPU
	Required for VA-API / QuickSync video core
	-	Newer CPU require OneAPI.

	For low-power, good results on Alder-Lake based SBC boards such as upcoming ZimaBlade, ZX05 etc.
	HW acceleration necesary due to tight CPU constraints.  Probably make stellar low-cost decoders!

	WiFi 6 networking via PCIe is highly recommended, 5ghz wifi capability is effectively a requirement. 
	USB works, however does introduce some overhead.
	
	B/G Band WiFi can be used, would NOT recommend.

	Older CPU's will work, but may struggle particularly with more advanced HEVC/VP9/AV1 codecs

	Not tested-
		NVIDIA HW Acceleration (no available hw platform)
		AMD HW Acceleration (no available hw platform)

	No issues with AMD CPU's for software-based decoding, but has only been briefly tested in home lab.

tested SBC's: 
+	manufacturer images
+	armbian
+	fedora ARM

	Khadas:
		VIM1			-	Too Slow, HDMI output issues.
		VIM3S			-	Functional, but blacks are crushed on video output.  
						HW Video acceleration and therefore custom kernel is a requirement.
		Edge2			-	Requires proprietary kernel from Khadas (Fenix) for proper video acceleration, hw encoding has issues
						can perform low-grade software encode but struggles with HEVC and higher..
	
	Orange Pi:
		OrangePi 4LTS		-	Software acceleration only, struggles on nearly every codec

	Odroid:
		Odroid M1		-	Manufacturer is missing wifi kernel modules, struggles on most codecs due to older design

	Raspberry Pi:
		?

	Mini-PC ZX05:
		Ali-Express Intel N95 derived SBC.  Works perfectly, full HW decode.  Can be run as server as long as you stick with HW encoding.

	Asus:
		Asus Mini-PC PN42.  Works perfectly. Can be run as server as long as you stick with HW encoding.

	ZimaBlade:
		In testing


	The Intel SBC are clear winners for target hardware down to cost, x86 compatibility and Intel's efforts on LibVA and OneAPI.  
	I'd like to circle back once we have some options with open-source Hardware encoding, however mainline ARM support seems very slow.
	For now, stick with x86.



Networking Equipment:

Wired:
	Extreme Networks switch (8port)
	TP-Link unmanaged switch


Wireless:
	Ruckus R350 Access Point 		-	Currently the recommended standard
	Ubiquiti AC-Pro			-	Functional but lacking WiFi6 support
	Ubiquiti UAP				-	B/G band WiFi too slow, worked on one or two decoders but performance was spotty
	Extreme Networks			-	AP needs a standalone mode, many enterprise AP's are not suitable for this reason

Network Cards:
	Hawking WiFi 6 USB 			-	Functional but USB adds unacceptable overhead
	Intel Built-In ??			-	No issues
	Mellanox CX2				-	To be tested (RoCE/RDMA support to further lower latency?)
	Intel X710				-	Good performance

HDMI Capture Devices:
	MageWell HDMI Capture Pro 	-	Fully supported.  Can be spotty on HDMI input due to HDCP issues.
						Recommend configuring via Windows configuration app prior to deployment for pixel formats
						
	LG USB Capture Cards		-	Fully supported.  
						Large delay when spinning up V4L2 capture.  
						Less fussy about video input than the Magewell

	BlackMagic Decklink		-	Requires DKMS module, which is thorny to build on CoreOS due to hurdles with rpm-ostree.
						Nearly all PCIE cards will require kernel modules, but should have better performance by 20ms/frame+

USB Input Devices:
	IPEVO Ziggy Document Camera 	- 	Fully supported @ 1080/30fps.   On some machines refuses to capture at above 15fps, however.
	ELMO document camera			-	not yet tested
	TESIRA ex-UBT				-	not yet tested (linux support on website isn't alluded to)
