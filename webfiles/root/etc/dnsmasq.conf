# Wavelet svr config file for DNSmasq
# provides DHCP and DNS functionality for the extremely simple network
# systemd-resolved probably needs tweaking to listen only on upstream interface, it shouldn't do anything on 
# the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet


# This component ensures:
# The server only works for *.wavelet.local
# It won't serve DNS/DHCP to a Public WiFi network (you'd need to edit that below)
# It's authoritative for the domain
# The DHCP range is heavily limited because we won't be needing more than 20 hosts
# ***These should be modified if you have any secure networks around that you don't want a rogue DHCP server touching.***
