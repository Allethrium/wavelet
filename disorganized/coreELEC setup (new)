coreELEC setup

needs right DTB.img for the board in question, booting is as simple as preconfiguring SD card, wriing the correct DTB and then booting with a blunt cocktail stick on the button.

Create a mountpoint and RAMdrive;
sudo mkdir -p /media/ramdisk
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=256M tmpfs /media/ramdisk

If we need more than 256m for the ramdisk we're in trouble as this board only has 1gb.  Oops.

ffmpeg command to output video stream to RAMdrive;
ffmpeg -i srt://192.168.1.32:6001 latency-5 -use_timeline 1 -use_template 1 -remove_at_exit 1 -window_size 5 -extra_window_size 5 -f dash -streaming 1 /media/ramdisk/output.mpd
