OrangePi4-LTS
Hex-core ARM
nice SDcard support, armbian just booted
Runs quite hot

OdroidM1:
Pain to boot from SD, seems limited to 264 encode/decode, no WiFi, hardkernel doesn't incl. common wifi drivers.   Generally a pain in the neck.

KhadasVIM1:
No HDMI output?  Useless.



KhadasVIM3:
Currently the top contender, OOWOW works well and decoder runs 264/265 workloads with no issues at all at 1080p.   Cooling unecessary!! Ultragrid compiled locally.
has a kernel 6.1 wifi regression patch that MUST be applied;

sudo dpkg -i  linux-dtb-amlogic-mainline_1.4.2_arm64.deb linux-image-amlogic-mainline_1.4.2_arm64.deb
sync
sudo reboot





KhadasEdge2:
OOWOW imaged but platform hardware too new to expect anything but bare functionality atm

Raspberry Pi 4:
can't source one

Eventual aims:
Fully OSS RISC-V thing with fully open-source GPU for encoding/decoding.

Current state of the art seems to be waiting on a project called "panfrost" which aims to support all ARM Mali based GPU acceleration which presumably includes whatever video codecs are in there.
