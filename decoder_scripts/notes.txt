Notes regarding target SBC:


OrangePi4-LTS:
Hex-core ARM
nice SDcard support, armbian just booted with no fuss.
Runs quite hot, HW decode support problematic.  Try on OrangePi custom kernel and see if any better?

OdroidM1:
Pain to boot from SD, seems limited to 264 encode/decode, no WiFi, hardkernel doesn't incl. common wifi drivers.   Generally a pain in the neck.  Beefy CPU so with any luck and some mainline goodness...?

KhadasVIM1:
TBA - had some issues with display output, needs work.
HDMI pops HDCP errors, so there's probably a config I can tweak.  Performance was lacklustre but on paper should be able to handle it.  Needs more work.  Would be very cheap.

KhadasVIM3:
Currently the top contender, OOWOW works well and decoder runs 264/265 workloads with no issues at all at 1080p.   Cooling unecessary!! Ultragrid compiled locally.

KhadasEdge2:
OOWOW imaged but platform hardware too new to expect anything but bare functionality atm.  Armbian support incoming 3/2023

Raspberry Pi 4:
Probably the best mainline support but you can't get them in quantity.

Eventual aims:
Fully OSS RISC-V thing with fully open-source GPU for encoding/decoding.
